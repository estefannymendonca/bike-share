This is the **Cyclistic bike-share analysis case study!** In this case study, I will perform many real-world tasks of a junior data analyst. I will work for a fictional company, Cyclistic, in order to answer the key business questions, I will follow the steps of the data analysis process: **ask, prepare, process, analyze, share, and act.** This project is part of the curriculum of the Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate. 

The company offers **bike-share program** that features more than 5,800 bicycles and 600 docking stations. Cyclistic sets itself apart by also offering reclining bikes, hand tricycles, and cargo bikes, making bike-share more inclusive to people with disabilities and riders who can’t use a standard two-wheeled bike. The majority of riders opt for traditional bikes; about 8% of riders use the assistive options. Cyclistic users are more likely to ride for leisure, but about 30% use them to commute to work each day.
